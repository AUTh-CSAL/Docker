Start by downloading the content of this repo, either through `git clone https://github.com/AUTh-csal/Docker.git` or by zip download here:

Afterwards, by opening a terminal or Command Prompt, according to your host OS, navigate to the folder where the extracted data is (default extracted folder is `Docker`). There you can see the following directory structure (timestamps may vary!):

```

For Windows users, navigate to the `Windows` directory and then run `hpc-build-image.bat`, `hpc-create-container.bat` and `hpc-start-container.bat`. The screenshots below show the expected behavior.

For Linux and MacOS users, remain in this folder, run `hpc-build-image`, `hpc-create-container` and `hpc-start-container`.
