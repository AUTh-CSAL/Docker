# A Docker image for providing a unified computing system for coursework

## Installation of the CSAL Docker image

Note: This README assumes that there is already Docker installed on the host machine, either Windows, MacOS or Linux. For more info on how to obtain Docker, please visit:

https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

Start by downloading the content of this repo, either through `git clone https://github.com/AUTh-csal/Docker.git` or by zip download here:
 
https://github.com/AUTh-csal/Docker/archive/main.zip 

Afterwards, by opening a terminal or Command Prompt, according to your host OS, navigate to the folder where the extracted data is (default extracted folder is `Docker`). There you can see the following directory structure (timestamps may vary!):

```
2020-09-29  08:57    <DIR>          .
2020-09-29  08:57    <DIR>          ..

```
For Windows users, navigate to the `Windows` directory and then run `hpc-build-image.bat`, `hpc-create-container.bat` and `hpc-start-container.bat`. The screenshots below show the expected behavior respectively (folder names may vary, I have used `c:\git\Docker2` as my base folder).

![hpc-start-container](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16119641/95838179-c25f6880-0d41-11eb-82e7-40ef30f7ccb5.png)

For Linux and MacOS users, remain in this folder, run `hpc-build-image`, `hpc-create-container` and `hpc-start-container`.

## Pulling & building hello world examples for the course 050 - Parallel & Distributed Systems

After succesfully having built, created and ran the container, you should be able to see the following screen, aka `welcome screen`.

Then you can clone our `pds-codebase` repo by envoking the command `git clone https://github.com/AUTh-csal/pds-codebase.git` inside the container, as shown in the screenshow below.

Then you can `cd` into the new folder by `cd pds-codebase` and do a `make all` and `make test` and you should be able to build all the hello world examples and run their respective tests as show below.
